# Codemkin

Codemkin is an application that watches your files and stores changes. It allows you to create montages of your 
programming process, storing every single change you make to your code. This allows you to replay your programming.

## TODO
-  ~~Display file history~~
-  ~~Revert back to version~~
-  Provide option to copy snippet
-  Store a master list of cdmkn repos at root

## Ideas

- Leverage git for intelligent file diffing and storage
- How to run on startup
- Perf (good enough?)
- Storage requirements
- Error handling (what happens when we run out of space?)
